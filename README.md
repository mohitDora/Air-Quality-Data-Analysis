# **Air Quality Data Analysis**

Urban pollution is a growing concern, negatively impacting public health and the environment. This project aims to analyze air quality data to gain insights into pollution sources and patterns. Utilizing advanced data analysis techniques, we intend to propose effective interventions that align with Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11): Sustainable Cities and Communities, which seeks to make cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable.

## **Tools Used**

- **Python**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For documenting the analysis process.
- **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.



## **API Reference**

- Kaggle Air Quality Data in India (2015 - 2020)


## **Methodology**

The project will be conducted in the following phases:
- **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Gathered air quality data from Kaggle and additional sources. Handled missing values, outliers, inconsistencies, and standardized data formats.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performed statistical analysis to understand pollutant distribution and variability. Visualized temporal trends and spatial distributions using charts and maps.
- **Source Identification**: Used correlation analysis and regression models to identify potential pollution sources and industry impacts.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Developed and validated random forest models to predict future pollution levels based on historical data.
- **Solution Development**: Proposed solutions such as stricter emissions regulations, public transportation promotion, and green infrastructure. Assessed feasibility and potential impact of solutions.
- **Reporting and Presentation**: Compiled findings into a comprehensive report. Created visualizations, interactive dashboards, and policy briefs for stakeholders.
